      <h1>So long, GitKraken</h1>
      <blockquote>
        After nearly 6 years of using my favourite Git GUI, a disastrous outage
        led me to turning over a new leaf.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        On September 18th 2023, GitKraken experienced an outage impacting their
        licensing servers, that lasted for several hours. The immediate result
        was that every paid user was effectively deemed a &quot;Free Plan&quot;
        user, completely locking them out of private repositories (access to
        private repos being a paid feature). Users would also get a notification
        that their subscription had expired, prompting confusion. Especially
        with anyone who only recently had renewed their yearly subscription.
      </p>
      <p>
        People immediately took to Twitter, waiting for an acknowledgement from
        the GitKraken team that they were aware of the issue and were working on
        a fix. Unfortunately, it took the GitKraken team several
        <strong>hours</strong> to formulate said reply, paired with an update to
        their status page. This update however, provided little to no
        information on the actual issue, aside from stating partial disruption:
      </p>

          title="The GitKraken status page during the outage, only showing a &#x27;Partial Disruption&#x27; notice."
        />
      </p>
      <h2>Non-negotiable</h2>
      <p>
        That said, the lack of clear and timely communication was not what
        caused me to switch. What did was the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The GitKraken client performs no caching of subscription tokens</li>
        <li>it also doesn&#x27;t have any kind of grace period</li>
        <li>let alone a gracious response to cloud outages</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This made me effectively incapable of using their software in my
        specific professional setting:
      </p>
      <p>

          alt="GitKraken outage"
          title="Many users received this message during the outage, saying The Free Plan does not support private repositories."
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        I was unable to commit to a private repository for hours, even though my
        subscription was valid until February 2024.<br />
        <!-- -->Regardless of how long I had been using GitKraken problem-free,
        and regardless of how much I loved their products, this was and still is
        a non-negotiable for me.
      </p>
      <h2>A new leaf... er fork</h2>
      <p>
        Thus began a search for a new Git GUI client. For critical and immediate
        changes I temporarily relied on VS Code&#x27;s Git client, which was not
        ideal.<br />
        <!-- -->I prefer having a view on changes inside the repository, not
        just my (un)staged changes. I&#x27;m working in a collaborative
        environment after all.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a quick search through popular Git clients, I eventually followed
        up on a colleague&#x27;s recommendation and tried out
        <a href="https://fork.dev">Fork</a>. I must say, integrating with a
        VPN-locked, private Bitbucket repository actually felt so better much
        compared to GitKraken! I was not expecting that.<br />
        <!-- -->Additionally I installed
        <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> for any
        personal work that could benefit from it, but I honestly doubt that
        I&#x27;ll need it anytime soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Will Fork last me another 6 years like GitKraken did? Only time will
        tell, but I have committed to paying their one-time fee, once I&#x27;m
        used to it after a couple weeks of usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        And, who knows! Hopefully GitKraken improves their disaster recovery
        protocol as well as graciously handling outages. Especially on the
        end-user&#x27;s side! I might even come back if they do, but for now
        I&#x27;m sticking with Fork ðŸ©µ.
